# SevenDragons
This is a  sample implementation of the seven dragon game by Andrew Looney in C++. The GUI aspect of the game was neglected because what is actually of importance here is the use of advance c++ concepts.
Some of those concepts but not all are:

- shr_ptr
- iterators
- std structures(list, vector ... )
- uni_ptr
- functor
- operator definition
- generic types
